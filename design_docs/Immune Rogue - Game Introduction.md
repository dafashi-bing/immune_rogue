## 🧬 **The Mutation: From Shape Rogue to Immune Rogue**

### **Thematic Evolution**
What began as **Shape Rogue**—a game of geometric shapes battling in abstract arenas—has **mutated** into **Immune Rogue**, transforming mathematical simplicity into biological warfare:

- **Geometric Shapes → Immune Cells**: Heroes evolved from abstract shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square) into living immune cells (Macrophage, Plasma Cell, Helper T-cell)
- **Abstract Enemies → Pathogens**: Enemies transformed from geometric threats into biological pathogens (Influenza Virus, Pseudomonas Bacterium, E. coli Swarm)
- **Mathematical Arenas → Biological Biomes**: Battlefields shifted from geometric spaces to living environments (skin tissue, gut lumen, bloodstream)
- **Shape Abilities → Cellular Functions**: Abilities evolved from geometric mechanics to biological processes (Engulf Surge, Antibody Lance, Cytokine Burst)

### **What Stayed the Same**
The core gameplay loop remains unchanged:
- Time-based wave survival (30 seconds per wave)
- Between-wave shop system with strategic upgrades
- Multiple game modes (Normal, Endless, 1HP Challenge)
- 8-directional movement with auto-shooting
- Energy-based ability system
- Ultimate abilities that charge through combat

### **What Mutated**
- **Visual Identity**: Pixel art shifted from geometric minimalism to biological detail
- **Narrative Context**: Abstract combat became a story of immune defense
- **Ability Names**: "Rolling Surge" → "Engulf Surge", "Spike Shot" → "Antibody Lance"
- **Enemy Identity**: Each enemy now represents a real-world pathogen with biological accuracy
- **Biome System**: Backgrounds now represent different body systems and tissues
