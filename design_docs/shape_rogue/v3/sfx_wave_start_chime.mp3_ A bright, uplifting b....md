sfx_wave_start_chime.mp3: A bright, uplifting bell‐like chime sequence (~1.2s) with clear metallic tones, a simple rising major triad melody, and subtle reverb to signal wave start.  

sfx_drone_deploy.mp3: A futuristic drone deployment sound (~0.8s) combining a soft electronic whoosh, servo‐motor whirs and clicks, and light metallic unfolding noises with a cool digital sheen.  

sfx_bomber_explode.mp3: A heavy, tight explosion (~1.5s) featuring a deep low‐frequency boom (50–200 Hz), mid-range metallic shrapnel impacts (500–2000 Hz), and high-end fizz/crackle, with a sudden peak and quick decay into rumble.  

sfx_sniper_snipe.mp3: A precise long-range shot (~0.6s) with a sharp, high-tension laser or rail-gun discharge “snap,” a brief high-velocity whoosh, and a short echo tail to imply open space.  

sfx_splitter_split.mp3: A rapid fracturing effect (~0.7s) beginning with a crisp crack (like crystalline glass), followed by quick twinkling chimes and subtle digital “poof” glitches for each fragment.  

sfx_mine_deploy.mp3: A tactical mine placement (~1.0s) with a soft metallic clank, low-level hydraulic hiss, and a sequence of three quick arming beeps, recorded close‐miked for intimacy.  

sfx_mine_explode.mp3: A medium‐scale mine detonation (~1.3s) featuring a punchy mid-low explosion (100–300 Hz), sharp high-frequency cracks, debris whooshes, and a faint echo to suggest environment interaction.
